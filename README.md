# Optimize Farming with Environmental Indexes Tracking and Irrigation Control via LoRaWAN
This project uses the IBM LMIC library which ported from AVR/espressif and only supports LoRaWan class A, B. I used class A for this project, you may  refer to [LoRaWan classes](https://www.semtech.com/uploads/technology/LoRa/lorawan-device-classes.pdf) for more details before proceeding.<br>
I recommend using the STM32WB or STM32WL series to fully explore the potential of LoRaWAN with [I-CUBE-LRWAN Expansion Package](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/i-cube-lrwan.html).<br>
Include: OneWire, I2C, SPI, UART, DMA, ADC, PWM Timer, Interrupt, and Sleep mode <br>
